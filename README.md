# Skin Cancer Detection with CNN - Deep Learning

## Project Overview
Skin Cancer Detection is an AI-powered project that uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to classify skin lesion images as benign or malignant. This project aims to assist dermatologists by providing an automated and accurate early detection system for skin cancer.

The model is trained on a dataset of skin lesion images and uses **Deep Learning techniques** for image classification. The final model is deployed as a web application for easy accessibility.
